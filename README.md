# **Edge Detection**

Edge detection is a crucial technique in image processing, computer vision, and pattern recognition. This project demonstrates the implementation of Gaussian blur, Sobel edge detection, non-maximum suppression, and percentile thresholding to detect and highlight edges in a grayscale image. By combining these techniques, the project successfully produces an edge-detected output, which can be used as a basis for further image analysis and object recognition tasks.
